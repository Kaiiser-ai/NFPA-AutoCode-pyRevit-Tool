# 🔥 NFPA AutoCode – pyRevit Tool

A rule-based, automated NFPA compliance checker designed to run inside **pyRevit**.  
This tool aims to help architects, BIM modelers, and code reviewers automatically verify  
key NFPA Life Safety requirements directly from Revit models.

---

## 📌 Project Goal

To develop an automated NFPA rule-checking extension for Revit using **pyRevit**,  
capable of detecting life safety violations such as:

- Dead-end corridor lengths  
- Travel distance limitations  
- Occupant load calculations  
- Door clear width  
- Stair width  
- Corridor width  
- Exit access  
- And more (as features are added)

This repository will serve as the development base for the full NFPA AutoCode tool.
